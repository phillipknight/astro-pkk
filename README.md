# A new adventure with Astro

I'm rebuilding my personal professional [website](https://www.phillipkentknight.com), and along the way I'm learning to develop web applications with Astro. 

## Current Status 

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f3651fa6-0509-4dfd-b7ed-7413bb7ba1dc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/pkk-astro/deploys)

This project is currently in development; This project will likely not have an end point but my plan is to quickly launch an MVP to replace my previous site. 

## Development 

- Initial scaffolding for this project was accomplished by following the official Astro tutorial ["Build a Blog"](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/), which begins with "Astro Starter Kit: Minimal" and includes great modules to help understand the various basic concepts for building with Astro. 
- Version control is managed in *this* GitHub repository.
- Builds are hosted and continuous deployment is managed by Netlify. 
- Some components have been imported from [Accessible Astro Components](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-components)
