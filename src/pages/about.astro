  <h2>Tinkering with technology and trying to make a difference</h2>
  <p>
    I've spent over a decade helping campaigns and nonprofit organizations build
    and manage web products designed to change the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Combining experience in campaigns with expertise in technology, I help teams
    bridge the gaps between creators, campaigners, developers, and stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
    My early career included front-line field organizing, traditional
    communications, and campaign strategy. Now, my specialty is bringing this
    knowledge into the digital products I build.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work well with campaigners and designers, and I'm happy to facilitate
    collaboration on topics including accessibility, frontend code, user
    experience, and product development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm continuously learning and expanding my technical skillset both
    professionally and for fun. I'm comfortable building production-quality CSS,
    HTML, and JavaScript as well as working with modern frameworks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of my best work has been using, hacking, extending, and integrating the
    most powerful and popular toolsets including platforms like ActionKit,
    Ghost, WordPress, NationBuilder, and New/Mode.
